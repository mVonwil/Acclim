  - Surprise honey!
  - I sent this letter out on the day of your flight, I even paid extra to have it
    delivered via the automated express mailing service. The people at the post assured
    me that it will arrive at your apartment before you do. Hopefully it arrives on
    time like they promised! If it works out, I think I will keep using express post,
    that way you only have to wait for one day to receive my letters! Do not stress
    out, about the expenses as I think the extra cost is worth it.
  - You have to tell me what it was like to fly on the dirigible was like! I heard
    dirigibles were smooth and comfortable. Luxurious even! Either way, I hope you
    had a good journey since it is your first time travelling somewhere on your own,
    especially to a foreign country so far away from home!
  - I am so proud of you for chasing your dreams and that you were determined to see
    it through to the end. Even if it meant moving to a completely different country
    on your own. I am worried however, are you sure you will be able to learn the
    local language quickly? I remember you were often frustrated during your language
    classes. Although I suppose you do have a good motivation for learning a new language
    as soon as possible. Patience is key! Do not forget that!
  - Do not forget to look after yourself! You have a tendency to forget to look after
    your health due to your one-track mind once you get focused on a goal. I know
    you are rather introverted, preferring to be in your room but please do try to
    get out and socialize. Make some friends, they will be able to help you when you
    need it the most. Write back soon!

  - Hello sweetheart,
  - Harriet, I did not mean to upset you with my last letter regarding learning the
    language. I did not mean to come across as sounding as if I doubted you. It is
    my job to worry as a mother, as your mother. The only reason why I mentioned it
    at all was because I remember your impatience during those classes, especially
    when your father and I were teaching you the different dialects spoken by the
    locals at Equine. Although the source of your impatience, seem to be stemmed from
    the fact that the lessons took you away from your tinkering projects that you
    found more interesting.
  - With that said, do not doubt how proud your father and I are of you. You know
    your father and I did not have a good education. To hear that our daughter graduated
    from university with distinction and was accepted into Brisk Technologies, a prestigious
    company known for its innovation. Although, I think your Aunt Pamela is skeptical
    that you were given a job offer, but ignore her. She has always been petty.
  - Will you be home for the Yule celebrations? If you are coming home for Yule, I
    will make sure to cook your favorite dishes. Do not forget to write me at least
    weekly letters to let me know you are okay, and your life in SloeWaden.

    community. My name is Vera Fowler and I live a few doors down the hallway from
    you. I am the local Geriffa at the apothecary over at Millvale Road. '
  - "Like you, I moved here far away from my hometown so I know what it is like being
    all alone in a strange new place. Luckily our community is centered on the concept
    of family, so that means when you moved into the complex, you gained a new family!
    Our community has a different event for each day of the week which helps newcomers\u2019
    acclimatize to their new home and make some new friends. So do not be afraid to
    come join on some of the events and mingle with other residents. Every Friday
    is game\u2019s night, so do not be afraid to join in! We have a mix of games such
    as: board games, cards, chess and more! "
  - With that said, I hope to see you around and hearing from you. Please do not hesitate
    to contact me if you need anything or have questions.
  - "Best Regards, Vera Fowler\t "
  - 24th April 1873
  - Hello sweetheart,
  - It makes me so happy to hear you are settling okay in your new apartment. Hearing
    you enjoyed your first few days of work was even better. You certainly sound very
    excited about your new life in SloeWaden.
  - Make sure you attended the first session of the language course! You are going
    to need all the help you can get in your crash course. I hope you plan on attending
    the Saturday group meeting, since you will be meeting others who like you, moved
    far away from home to live and work. At the very least, attend one of the meetings
    even if you much rather stay in your room. You did promise me to make an effort
    to make friends and socialize more!
  - 'Before I forget, the neighbor next door, his daughter keeps asking whether it
    is true you are living at SloeWaden now. She was rather persistent in finding
    out whether it was possible to live with you as a roommate. Before you panic,
    I already told her it would not be possible due to your rental agreement as you
    chose a studio apartment for one tenant only. I know you like your personal space.
    Given how both of your personalities clashed in the past, I can imagine how upset
    you would be having to share your safe place with someone else.  '
  - "Your father seems to have caught the tinkerer\u2019s bug lately, he\u2019s been
    fiddling around in the garage a lot these days. Before I forget, do you know how
    many weeks you will have off for the Yule break? Make sure you confirm how many
    weeks you have off, and whether you are coming home for the celebrations. "

  - Hello sweetheart,
  - It does sound slightly ambitious to be elected as lead automaton artificer for
    an upcoming project, especially since you are new employee. However knowing you,
    you most likely have several design proposals planned out or ready to submit to
    the project board already. Remember to look after your health. It will do you
    no good being chosen for the project, only to go down with some form of fatigue
    or sickness because you did not look after yourself.
  - "It was awfully nice of your neighbor to introduce herself. I hope you returned
    the favor and introduced yourself. If you haven\u2019t yet, make sure to reply
    to her letter at the very least. "
  - 'I am so happy to hear you are coming home for the Yule break. Glad to hear you
    do not need to return till after the second week into the New Year. We will have
    just over a month to catch up properly in person. Remind me to make some of your
    favorite pickled eggs so you can take some back.   '

  - 'There is the Anvil Reservoir Garden, a truly beautiful place. Very quiet and
    serene, I am sure you will enjoy the beauty of nature. I have gone to the garden
    many times myself, whether it is to just enjoy a walk or simply read a book. '
  - If you need any research done, we have the famous National Library. The library
    is world-class and boasts as a research center for people in various fields. I
    visited the library numerous times for research or keep up-to-date on the latest
    medical advances, as the medical field is ever-changing. It has a lovely collection
    of fictional novels as well. Although I am sure you been here before for the language
    lessons.
  - On the entertainment side, SloeWaben has a circus permanently based here. It is
    not far off from Alderdenn Street actually, about a thirty minute walk from here.
    The shows are usually sold out, so it is best to book a ticket in advanced to
    ensure you can get a seat. Perhaps we could watch one of the circus performances
    together some time?
  - "My suggestion is when you have the chance, to get out and explore the city. There
    is so much to explore and experience! If you like, I can accompany you and show
    you around some of the local attractions as well. \t"

  - Dear Ms. Danvers
  - "Congratulations on being elected as automaton artificer for Brisk Technologies\u2019
    latest endeavor. Your role is to design and implement cost-effective equipment
    modifications to improve safety and reliability. You will be working with fellow
    colleagues on this project, together you will be developing, testing and evaluating
    those designs. "
  - "The project goal is to design an automaton to drill through dirt and rock for
    subway tunnels, as part of our ongoing improvement on the city\u2019s transportation
    infrastructure.  With that said, please be aware that project\u2019s final blueprint
    for the automaton is due in 13 days."
  - I am looking forward to seeing your preliminary designs in the first project meeting
    tomorrow morning.

  - Hello honey,
  - 'I cannot say I am too pleased hearing you been neglecting your health lately.
    I understand you truly wanted to be chosen to be the automaton artificer for the
    project, but you really must take care of yourself. You do not have me or your
    father to remind you to eat or sleep on time anymore. '
  - Also, remember you are just a newly hired employee so it is very likely you will
    not get the job. I know this is not what you want to hear, but I do not want you
    to get your hopes up and have them dashed. Thinking about how you loved to invent
    your own machines and designed the blueprints on your own, it does give you a
    good chance of being chosen or at least be considered for future projects.
  - 'That reminds me, your father asked me if you still have your original blueprints
    for the chronometric gauge somewhere in your room. It has been acting up lately
    and he has trouble nailing down the problem issue. He hopes the blueprints will
    help him disassemble it easily and narrow the possible causes. I just pray he
    can put it back together again, correctly! Make sure to send him a letter on where
    the blueprint is and anything else you can think of regarding the gauge. '
  - I am glad you are getting along with your neighbors and making new friends during
    the language lessons!
  - ' Love, Mom & Dad '
  - 5th May 1873
  - Hello sweetie!
  - "You were elected to be the project\u2019s automaton artificer? Congratulations!
    We are so proud of you! I understand you cannot go into details regarding the
    project but we are so proud and excited for you. Those proposals you handed proved
    your dedication and knowledge, they must been very impressive for the project
    board to choose you."
  - 'Before you get too upset with my last sentence just remember this: you got chosen
    over experienced artificers who have been in the company longer than you have
    been. To have a new employee chosen to lead a project is nearly unheard off, especially
    given how Brisk Technologies often undertake massive projects.'
  - "Remember: your father and I are proud of you! Do not let others like your Aunt
    Pamela bring you down. You have shown you are a strong woman by striking it out
    on your own. You are capable by being employed by Brisk Technologies, known for
    their innovations for transport technologies and infrastructure. You are determined
    as you worked hard and succeeded in your goal in becoming elected as the project\u2019s
    automaton artificer. You have nothing to prove. Nothing."
  - 'Love, Mom & Dad '
  - 10th May 1873
  - Hi darling,
  - So sorry to hear you been stressed out lately with the company project lately.
    I understand your frustration with the automaton engineers, but you have to understand
    while you may understand your design blueprint, they may not. The language barrier
    certainly does not help matters. I know you been pushing yourself hard to learn
    the language, but you need to realize you will not master a new language overnight
    nor will you master by trying to force yourself past your breaking point.
  - ' These things take time. You have been there for just under a month, you made
    leaps and bounds in everything you done so far. Learning the language to the point
    you can somewhat converse with most locals and be understood, learning your way
    around a new city and its culture. Maybe you just need time to breathe and look
    at the issue again with fresh eyes. Perhaps building a small prototype will help
    the engineers understand your design better?'
  - "On the bright side, at least your design was approved! So that is something positive
    at the very least honey. Your father will like to say that he is proud of you,
    and to \u2018keep your head up\u2019. He said you will understand what he means.
    Remember honey, this is just a small hurdle, a storm that will soon pass. Once
    it does, you will be grateful for the experience and lessons learnt. "
  - 'Stick it out! Just remember if worse comes to worse, you can always come home. '
  - 'Love, Mom & Dad '

  - Hello Harriet,
  - Just wanted to check in on you. I noticed lately you have not been going out much
    unless it is for work or to run errands. When I have managed to see you, you looked
    extremely pale and fatigued. Based on your dark eye bags, I assume you have not
    been getting much sleep. So I wanted to check in on you to make sure everything
    was okay.
  - 'If you need to talk, you know where to find me. Or if you like, I can come over
    to check on you. Do not forget I am a Geriffa so if you are sick, I can help you
    get better with remedies. '
  - Some of the residents including myself are going to Litwaack Circus to enjoy carnival
    night. You are more than welcome to join us. You look like you could use a break.
    Of course, if you are unwell, you may be better off resting at home. Either way,
    let me know if you are joining us. We meet at the lobby at 4pm tonight.

  - Dear Ms. Danvers
  - 'During the last project meeting, you and your colleagues presented several designs
    for Project Burrow. The meeting ended with one of your designs chosen as the chosen
    final design for the new automaton that Project Burrow will be using. '
  - I was very impressed that the team presented a few small-scale working prototypes
    as proof of concept. Others on the company board expressed their appreciation
    for the initiative shown regarding the prototypes, and your dedication to this
    project.
  - Furthermore, I am pleased with how the project is going and remaining on track
    with the given deadline. I am looking forward to the final results. Keep up the
    good work!

  - Dear Ms. Danvers
  - 'Many congratulations for your success and achievement in our organization. With
    all your hard work and dedication towards your work, you have proven you have
    all capabilities to handle many big projects in the future. Your ability to play
    an important role in the team and keeping your cool under pressure, resulted in
    a significant increase of success for the project Burrow as the mechanical design
    engineer. With the bonus of the project finishing possibly ahead of schedule. '
  - "As you know, project Burrow was Brisk Technologies\u2019 latest and most ambitious
    project to date. Other companies in the past have tried to create subterranean
    tunnels for trains, but failed. With your design, it seems we will be to achieve
    our goal of improving the transportation infrastructure, having trains travel
    more efficiently underground instead of aboveground. "
  - Thus the current success of the project belongs to you. We are very satisfied
    with your work and have heard your fellow team members praising your work. Hence
    we, the company have decided to send you this letter, to inform you of our appreciation
    to you and your work dedication.
  - Once again, congratulations and we hope you will maintain this attitude and work
    ethic throughout your future projects.

  - 'I know we talked already earlier today but I just wanted to say again, that I
    am glad to see and hear you feeling much better compared to last week. Do try
    and make sure you look after yourself, otherwise I will be forced to order you
    some bed rest. '
  - "Yes, it was a shame you missed carnival night. We\u2019ll make sure you make
    it to the next carnival night! You will enjoy it, as it is always a spectacular
    show. I was just wondering if you would like to join me and a few other residents
    in the annual sports day event. We compete in various sports against other residents
    from nearby apartment complexes. We are competing against the residents at the
    Franklin Hill Complex this upcoming weekend. If you do not want to participate,
    that is fine, as many others come to spectate as well. "
  - 'Either way, there is plenty of fun to be had. Free food and drinks with great
    company. Cannot go wrong with that. '
  - Write back soon and let me know if you plan on joining us or at least spectating
    the event!
  - 'Regards, Vera '

  - Hello sweetheart,
  - So sorry for taking so long to send you a letter. Aunt Pamela was stirring drama
    up again and I did not realize I never replied to your letter. Please do not be
    alarmed, sorry if we scared you from lack of reply.
  - " We are so proud that you overcame the hurdles you were experiencing. Hopefully
    now things will not be so stressful for you at work. It sounds like you have gained
    the engineering team\u2019s respect when you explained your design and showed
    a small prototype. I believe the language barrier will be a thing of the past
    as you are always attending the language lessons to improve your skills."
  - 'Thank you for sending the letter to your father about the chronometric gauge.
    The blueprint really helped him narrow what the problem was. He even managed to
    put it back together with no problems! Hopefully he sent you a letter to thank
    you, if not let me know and I will have some words with him. '
  - "We just heard on the radio that your company plans to dig out some tunnels for
    the locomotives to travel through. They even mentioned your name! We couldn\u2019t
    be any prouder of you. Congratulations! Your Aunt Pamela was so shocked to hear
    you being mentioned in the news. She actually called me to confirm the news and
    that you really worked for Brisk Technologies! I really do not understand why
    the thought of you working for a large well-known company is so earth-shattering
    for her. Especially since it is known within the family you love to invent. "
  - Enough about her, just know your mom and dad are proud of you for going out there
    and chasing your dream. Do not forget to look after yourself!
