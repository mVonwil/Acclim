  - Hello dear!
  - 'I hope you are settling alright in your new home and workplace! '
  - While I am not happy about you moving so far away, I understand your decision.
  - 'Your father and I are enjoying the break from the heat, especially after the
    harsh summer we experienced back home. '
  - 'We were considering going on a short holiday trip this month, visit the family
    up north. '
  - 'That reminds me, the strangest thing happened today. '
  - While out in the garden earlier this morning, a few of our neighbors approached
    me.
  - '. They kept asking me where you were since they have not seen you around for
    a few days now. '
  - 'Honestly, you think they would know that you have been gone for over a week now. '
  - 'When I told them you have moved for work over a week ago, they were shocked. '
  - 'Genuinely shocked! '
  - "Whether they were more shocked that you got the job or actually moved for it
    is anyone\u2019s guess. "
  - The nerve of some people!
  - 'Will you be coming home for Christmas? '
  - 'I know there is about 4 months to go, but it would be lovely if you could come
    over and visit during the winter holidays. '
  - 'If you are coming home for Christmas, please let me know and I will make sure
    to cook your favorites for Christmas dinner! '
  - 'We love and miss you honey! '
  - 'Do not forget to write back soon! '
  - I want to hear everything you been up too! Hopefully this letter will not take
    too long to reach you!
  - 'Love, Mom & Dad '

  - Hello neighbor!
  - I am sending this letter to you to introduce myself, and to welcome you to the
    community. My name is Vera Fowler and I live a few doors down the hallway from
    you. I work as a pharmacist over at Millvale Hospital.
  - "Like you, I moved here far away from my hometown so I know what it is like being
    all alone in a strange new place. Luckily our community is centered on the concept
    of family, so that means when you moved into the complex, you gained a new family!
    Our community has a different event for each day of the week which helps newcomers\u2019
    acclimatize to their new home and make some new friends. So do not be afraid to
    come join on some of the events and mingle with other residents. Every Monday
    is game\u2019s night, so do not be afraid to join in! We have a mix of games such
    as: board games, cards, chess and more! "
  - With that said, I hope to see you around and hearing from you. Please do not hesitate
    to contact me if you need anything or have questions.
  - "Best Regards, Vera Fowler\t "
  - '25 Calvary Lane Equine, HR 73820  August 12th 1945 '
  - Hello sweetheart,
  - It makes me so happy to hear you are settling okay with no problems, and that
    you had a great first day at your new job. It was awfully nice of your neighbor
    to introduce herself. Do try to remember to go out and socialize sometimes. Although
    you always did like tinkering with machines. I remember having to chase you out
    of your room or the garage all the time, especially when you got caught up with
    a new invention.
  - "It has been barely two weeks and I am missing you dreadfully. Your father too!
    Even if he will not admit it. The house is awfully quiet lately, without the clangs
    and bangs from you making a new gadget. Although I feel I may have spoken too
    soon as I seen your father looking over some blueprints lately, he may have caught
    the tinkerer\u2019s bug from you. If he does begin tinkering, I will at least
    know who to blame. Just kidding dear, you know I love you very much."
  - 'Before I forget, the neighbor next door, his daughter keeps asking whether it
    is true you are now living at SloeWaben now. I confirmed and she began asking
    questions. I think she intends asking whether she can move in with you. I already
    told her you live in a single apartment and cannot take a roommate in due to the
    rental agreement. '
  - Do you know how many weeks you will have off, for the Christmas break? Either
    way, it will be good to have you back home for Christmas. December cannot come
    fast enough.

  - Hello Harriet!
  - I hope I am not being too forward by using your first name. If it is, please let
    me know or if you have a preference in how you would like to be addressed.
  - 'Since you are new to the city, I thought I would write this letter to let you
    know the different attractions or places you can visit, that only locals would
    know about. '
  - 'I heard you were interested in machinery and that your job involved tinkering
    with automatons? There is the Historical Museum of Automatons which may interest
    you, as the name suggests, it is a museum regarding the history of automatons
    from the birth of automatons till present day. If I remember correctly, they had
    some original blueprints along with machines invented by inventors such as Da
    Vinci, Nikola Tesla and Lewis Pask. '
  - 'There is the Anvil Reservoir Garden, a truly beautiful place. Very quiet and
    serene, I am sure you will enjoy the beauty of nature. I have gone to the garden
    many times myself, whether it is to just enjoy a walk or simply read a book. '
  - If you need any research done, we have the famous National Library. The library
    is world-class and boasts as a research center for people in various fields. I
    visited the library numerous times for research or keep up-to-date on the latest
    medical advances, as the medical field is ever-changing. It has a lovely collection
    of fictional novels as well.
  - On the entertainment side, SloeWaben has a circus permanently based here. It is
    not far off from Alderdenn Street actually, about a thirty minute walk from here.
    The shows are usually sold out, so it is best to book a ticket in advanced to
    ensure you can get a seat. Perhaps we could watch one of the circus performances
    together some time?
  - I will close the letter here before my letter becomes several pages long. The
    places I mentioned are a mix of local and popular attractions. My suggestion is
    when you have the chance, to get out and explore the city. There is so much to
    explore and experience!

  - Dear Ms. Danvers
  - 'Congratulations on being elected as mechanical design engineer for Brisk Technologies
    latest endeavor. Your role design and implement cost-effective equipment modifications
    to improve safety and reliability. You will be working with fellow colleagues
    on this project, together you will be developing, testing and evaluating those
    designs. '
  - "The project goal is to design an automaton to drill through dirt and rock for
    subway tunnels, as part of our ongoing improvement on the city\u2019s transportation
    infrastructure. "
  - "With that said, please be aware that project\u2019s final blueprint for the automaton
    is due in 13 days."
  - I am looking forward to seeing your preliminary designs in the first project meeting
    tomorrow morning.
  - 'Sincerely, Marvin Leynthall p.p Louis Warbulton Secretary   '
  - '25 Calvary Lane Equine, HR 73820  August 12th 1945 '
  - Hello sweetie,
  - 'You have no idea how happy makes me to hear that you have a month off for the
    Christmas break. We will have plenty of time to catch up, you will have to tell
    me everything! '
  - 'I am sure you will get either job as the mechanical designer or as one of the
    engineers for the new automaton. You are certainly qualified for either job, as
    I remember you drawing your own blueprints for your inventions. Speaking of which,
    you may have to explain how you built the irrigation system for the farm. Your
    father and I been noticing the water flow has decreased over the last few days,
    your father plans on dismantling it to see what is wrong with it. He believes
    there is a blockage. However, he does not want to dismantle it yet till he knows
    how it works. '
  - 'Perhaps a letter to your father to explain it, or copy of the blueprint unless
    your original blueprint is still in you room? '
  - "Oh before I forget, your father seems to have caught the tinker\u2019s bug again.
    He has been fiddling around in the garage more lately."
  - 'Love, Mom & Dad '
  - '25 Calvary Lane Equine, HR 73820  August 12th 1945 '
  - Hi darling,
  - So sorry to hear you been stressed out lately with the company project lately.  I
    understand you are frustrated with the engineers, but you have to understand that,
    while you may understand your design, they may not. Maybe if you built some small
    working prototypes as a proof of concept will help the engineers understand?
  - 'On the bright side, at least your design was approved! So that is something positive
    at the very least honey. '
  - "Your father will like to say that he is proud of you, and to \u2018keep your
    head up\u2019. He said you will understand what he means. Remember honey, this
    is just a small hurdle, a storm that will pass. Once it passes, you will be grateful

  - Dear Ms. Danvers
  - 'During the last project meeting, you and your colleagues presented several designs
    for project Burrow. The meeting ended with one of your designs chosen as the chosen
    final design for the new automaton that project Burrow will be using. '
  - I was very impressed that the team presented a few small-scale working prototypes
    as proof of concept. Others on the company board expressed their appreciation
    for working models and the dedication shown.
  - Furthermore, I am pleased with how the project is going and remaining on track
    with the given deadline. I am looking forward to the final results. Keep up the
    good work!

  - Hi again Harriet,
  - I just wanted to check in on you. Forgive my forwardness, but these past few days,
    I noticed you have not been going out much beyond for work. When I have seen you,
    you looked rather pale and based on the dark eye bags I noticed, you have not
    been sleeping well either. So I just wanted to make sure if everything was okay
  - 'If you are ill, you are more than welcome to see me. Even though I am a pharmacist,
    I do have experiencing in diagnosing illness, or at least give you advice or prescribe
    the medication you may need to take. Or if you just needed somebody to talk too,
    you know where to find me!  '
  - Get well soon!
  - 'Regards, Vera  '

  - Dear Ms. Danvers
  - 'Many congratulations for your success and achievement in our organization. With
    all your hard work and dedication towards your work, you have proven you have
    all capabilities to handle many big projects in the future. Your ability to play
    an important role in the team and keeping your cool under pressure, resulted in
    a significant increase of success for the project Burrow as the mechanical design
    engineer. With the bonus of the project finishing possibly ahead of schedule. '
  - "As you know, project Burrow was Brisk Technologies\u2019 latest and most ambitious
    project to date. Other companies in the past have tried to create subterranean
    tunnels for trains, but failed. With your design, it seems we will be to achieve
    our goal of improving the transportation infrastructure, having trains travel
    more efficiently underground instead of aboveground. "
  - Thus the current success of the project belongs to you. We are very satisfied
    with your work and have heard your fellow team members praising your work. Hence
    we, the company have decided to send you this letter, to inform you of our appreciation
    to you and your work dedication.
  - Once again, congratulations and we hope you will maintain this attitude and work
    ethic throughout your future projects.

  - Hello Harriet,
  - 'Glad to see you are looking much better! I was starting to get worried about
    you. '
  - 'I was just wondering if you would like to join me and a few other residents in
    the annual sports day event. We compete in various sports against other residents
    from nearby apartment complexes. If you do not want to participate, that is fine,
    as many others come to spectate as well. '
  - 'Either way, there is plenty of fun to be had. Free food and drinks with great
    company. Cannot go wrong with that. '
  - Write back soon and let me know if you plan on joining us or at least spectating
    the event!
  - 'Regards, Vera '

  - Hello sweetheart,
  - "We are so proud that you overcame the hurdles you were experiencing. Hopefully
    now things will not be so stressful for you at work. It sounds like you have gained
    the artificers\u2019 respect when you explained your design and showed a small
    prototype. "
  - "I know it was my idea honey, but you were the one who took it that idea and made
    it work. Let\u2019s just say credit should go to the both of us, and call it even?"
  - 'Thank you for sending the letter to your father about the irrigation system.
    He said your letter along with the original blueprint helped him to narrow down
    where the problem was. He confirmed there was a blockage and removed it. He even
    managed to put it back together with no problems! Hopefully he sent you a letter
    to thank you, if not let me know and I will have some words with him. '
  - "We just heard on the radio that your company plans to improve and implement tunnels
    for the trains! They even mentioned your name! I am so proud of you honey.  Your
    aunt Linda was so shocked to hear you being mentioned in the news, connected with
    Brisk Technologies\u2019 latest project as their lead mechanical designer. She
    actually called me to confirm the news! I really do not understand why the thought
    of you working for a large well-known company is so earth-shattering for her.
    Especially since it is known within the family you love to invent. "
  - Enough about her, just know your mom and dad are proud of you for going out there
    and chasing your dream. Do not forget to look after yourself!
  - 'Love, Mom & Dad '
